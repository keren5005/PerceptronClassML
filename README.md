## Getting Started

To get started with this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/keren5005/PerceptronClassML.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

    ```shell
    pip install pandas numpy
    ```


3. Run the main script to see the Perceptron algorithm in action:

    '''shell
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

- The main script, `main.py`, demonstrates how to use the Perceptron algorithm on two different datasets.
- The `PrecptronModel` class in the `Perceptron_Class.py` module contains the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm.

## Code Overview

- `Perceptron_Class.py`: This module contains the `PrecptronModel` class that implements the Perceptron algorithm.
- `main.py`: This is the main script that demonstrates the use of the Perceptron algorithm on custom and provided datasets.
- `dataset.csv`: A sample dataset used in the main script for testing the Perceptron algorithm.

## Dataset

- The code includes a sample dataset named `dataset.csv` for testing the Perceptron algorithm. You can replace it with your own dataset if needed.
